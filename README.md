## VLM-in-a-Loop: 02501 Advanced Deep Learning in Computer Vision

Investigating whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can replace human annotators in human-in-the-loop systems for computer vision tasks (e.g., detection, segmentation). Projects explore VLM-driven object detection, segmentation correction, click simulation, data augmentation, and ambiguity resolution using datasets like COCO and PASCAL VOC.
